            With the default parameters, give it 5000 iterations or so to get the idea.
            <br/><br/>A self-organizing map is a fairly simple type of neural network, used mostly as a dimensionality reduction
            algorithm for data visualization purposes.
            <br/><br/>You see a network of neurons (white) trying to fit a blob of data (black) by picking a random datapoint,
            then dragging the closest neuron towards it. The dragging strength and the influence on neighboring neurons decay
            exponentially with each iteration. The network starts out as a random tangle, quickly smoothens out, then starts
            filling the space tighter.
            <br/><br/>You could do roughly the same thing with a string of numbered beads and a printout of a scatterplot
            (for a 2D to 1D reduction). You could then represent the 2D data (x, y coordinates of a point on the scatterplot)
            on a 1D number line (number on the bead closest to the particular point), and have a decent mapping for new datapoints
            as well.
